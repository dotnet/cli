Interested in .NET Core + ASP.NET 5 RC bits?
----------------------------------------

This toolchain is independent from the DNX-based .NET Core + ASP.NET 5 RC bits. If you are looking for .NET Core + ASP.NET 5 RC bits, you can find instructions on the http://get.asp.net/.  

Docker
------

You can also use our Docker base images found on https://hub.docker.com/r/microsoft/dotnet to set up your dev or testing environment for usage.  

Basic usage
-----------

When you have the .NET Command Line Interface installed on your OS of choice, you can try it out using some of the samples on the [dotnet/core repo](https://github.com/dotnet/core/tree/master/samples). You can download the sample in a directory, and then you can kick the tires of the CLI.


First, you will need to restore the packages:
	
	dotnet restore
	
This will restore all of the packages that are specified in the project.json file of the given sample.

Then you can either run from source or compile the sample. Running from source is straightforward:
	
	dotnet run
	
Compiling to IL is done using:
	
	dotnet build
This will drop a binary in `./bin/[configuration]/[framework]/[binary name]` that you can just run.

Finally, you can also try out native compilation using RyuJIT as shown below:  

	dotnet build --native

The following command will perform native compilation using the C++ Codegenerator:

    dotnet build --native --cpp

If you are in Windows, make sure that you run the above command inside the *VS 2015 x64 Native Tools* prompt, otherwise you will get errors. This command will drop a native single binary in `./bin/[configuration]/[framework]/native/[binary name]` that you can run.

**Note:** At this point, only the `helloworld` and `dotnetbot` samples will work with native compilation.

For more details, please refer to the [documentation](https://github.com/dotnet/corert/tree/master/Documentation).

Building from source
--------------------

If you are building from source, take note that the build depends on NuGet packages hosted on Myget, so if it is down, the build may fail. If that happens, you can always see the [Myget status page](http://status.myget.org/) for more info. 

Known issues
