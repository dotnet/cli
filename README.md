# This Repo has moved!

Going forward, this repo will be merged into https://github.com/dotnet/sdk.  Previous releases (prior to .NET 5) will still be serviced out of this repo.

At this point in time, the source code has been merged into https://github.com/dotnet/toolset, which will shortly itself be merged into https://github.com/dotnet/sdk.

If you have an issue to file, log it at https://github.com/dotnet/sdk as that will be the final resting place. If you have a code change to code that used to be in this repo, you can submit a PR to https://github.com/dotnet/toolset, but keep in mind that the code will be moved shortly to https://github.com/dotnet/sdk. If your change is not urgent, then you may wish to wait for that to happen and submit to https://github.com/dotnet/sdk after the final consolidation there, in order to avoid having to migrate your changes to a new PR.
