# This Repo has moved!

This repo has been merged into https://github.com/dotnet/sdk. All previous releases that were serviced out of this repo are now out of support. We have created [tags](https://github.com/dotnet/cli/tags) for all servicing branches if you still wish to build those branches. This repo will be made read-only on 2/17/2023
