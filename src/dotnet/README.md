# NAME

dotnet -- general driver for running the command-line commands

# SYNOPSIS

dotnet [--version] [--info] [--help] [--verbose] < command > [< args >]

# DESCRIPTION
dotnet is a generic driver for the CLI toolchain. Invoked on its own, it will give out brief usage instructions. 

Each specific feature is implemented as a command. In order to use the feature, it is specified after dotnet, i.e. `dotnet compile`. All of the arguments following the command are command's own arguments.  


# OPTIONS
`-v, --verbose`

    Enable verbose output.

`--version`

    Print out the version of the CLI tooling

`--info`

    Print out information about the CLI tooling

`-h, --help`

    Print out a short help and a list of current commands. 

# DOTNET COMMANDS

The following commands exist for dotnet.

`dotnet-compile(1)`

    Compile the application to either an intermediate language (IL) or to a native binary. 

`dotnet-restore(1)`

    Restores the dependencies for a given application. 

`dotnet-run(1)`

    Runs the application from source.

`dotnet-publish(1)`

    Publishes a flat directory that contains the application and its dependencies, including the runtime binaries. 

`dotnet-test(1)`

    Runs tests using a test runner specified in project.json.

`dotnet-new(1)`

    Initializes a sample .NET Core console application. 

# EXAMPLES

`dotnet new`

    Initializes a sample .NET Core console application that can be compiled and ran.

`dotnet restore`

    Restores dependencies for a given application. 

`dotnet compile`

    Compiles the application in a given directory. 

# ENVIRONMENT 

`DOTNET_PACKAGES`

    The primary package cache. If not set, defaults to $HOME/.nuget/packages on Unix or %LOCALAPPDATA%\NuGet\Packages (TBD) on Windows.

`DOTNET_PACKAGES_CACHE`

    The secondary cache. This is used by shared hosters (such as Azure) to provide a cache of pre-downloaded common packages on a faster disk. If not set it is not used.

`DOTNET_SERVICING`

    Specifies the location of the servicing index to use by the shared host when loading the runtime.
