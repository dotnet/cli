Breaking Changes:**
As part of reaching 1.0 we went through to audit the current implementation
and identify areas that didn't align with our conventions. For this release,
we're marking the endpoints as `[Obsolete]` and indicating the new location.
These will be cleaned up in the next release:
- `IGitHubClient.Notifications` -&gt; `IGitHubClient.Activity.Notifications` - #1019 via @M-Zuber
- `IGitHubClient.Repository.CommitStatus` -&gt; `IGitHubClient.Repository.Status` - #1043 via @RobPethick
- `IGitHubClient.Repository.Commits` -&gt; `IGitHubClient.Repository.Commit` - #1057 via @M-Zuber
- `IGitHubClient.Repository.RepoCollaborators` -&gt; `IGitHubClient.Repository.Collaborator` - #1040 via @M-Zuber
- `IGitHubClient.Repository.RepositoryComments` -&gt; `IGitHubClient.Repository.Comment` - #1044 via @M-Zuber
- `IGitHubClient.Release` -&gt; `IGitHubClient.Repository.Release` - #1058 via @RobPethick
- `IGitHubClient.GitDatabase` -&gt; `IGitHubClient.Git` - #1048 via @RobPethick
Other breaking changes:
- a public `ApiExtensions.Get&lt;T&gt;` extension method was causing a bunch of
tests to be written in a confusing way. This has been ported to an interface
method on `IApiConnection` but hopefully you're not referencing this method
externally - see #1063 for more information.
- `IRepositoryContentsClient.GetArchiveLink` is no longer correct, as the HTTP
behaviour in Octokit was updated to follow redirects received from the server.
See #986 for the last bits of cleanup.
- `IRepositoryContentsClient.GetAllContents(string owner, string name, string path, string reference)`
has been renamed to `GetAllContentsByRef(string owner, string name, string path, string reference)`
to prevent overlap with methods on `IRepositoryContentsClient` which do not
specify a path - and thus look at the root of the repository.
- `IssueEventPayload` has two fields which are never populated from the API -
`Assignee` and `Label` - these are now removed. You should use
`Issue.Assignee` and `Issue.Labels` instead. See #1039 for more details.
- `PullRequest.MergeCommitSha` is marked as obsolete by the GitHub API - we
are cleaning up the behaviour for determining whether a PR has been
merged in #997 - see the PR for more information.
- `IAuthorizationsClient.RevokeAllApplicationAuthentications` is no longer
available through the GitHub API - this will be removed in the next
release.
Shout outs**
A lot of extra work went into this release, and I wanted to thank those people
who helped out - without their efforts we wouldn't be at this point:
- @naveensrinivasan - for helping set up our Travis CI builds to test this on
Mono - see #995 for the details
- @hahmed - for contributing a bunch of documentation around the Octokit search
APIs - see #955, #954 and #951
- @JakesCode - for clarifying some documentation after he reported an issue - #1054
- @ryangribble - for helping get our GitHub Enterprise testing off the ground - #987
- @naveensrinivasan - for catching and addressing an issue with our LINQPad snippets - #987</releaseNotes>
