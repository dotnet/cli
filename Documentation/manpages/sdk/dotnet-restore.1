\f[C]dotnet\-restore\f[] \- Restores the dependencies and tools of a
project
.SS SYNOPSIS
.PP
\f[C]dotnet\ restore\ [\-\-source]\ \ \ \ \ \ \ [\-\-packages]\ [\-\-disable\-parallel]\ \ \ \ \ \ \ [\-\-fallbacksource]\ [\-\-configfile]\ [\-\-verbosity]\ \ \ \ \ [<root>]\f[]
.SS DESCRIPTION
.PP
The \f[C]dotnet\ restore\f[] command uses NuGet to restore dependencies
as well as project\-specific tools that are specified in the
project.json file.
By default, the restoration of dependencies and tools are done in
parallel.
.PP
In order to restore the dependencies, NuGet needs the feeds where the
packages are located.
Feeds are usually provided via the NuGet.config configuration file; a
default one is present when the CLI tools are installed.
You can specify more feeds by creating your own NuGet.config file in the
project directory.
Feeds can also be specified per invocation on the command line.
.PP
For dependencies, you can specify where the restored packages are placed
during the restore operation using the \f[C]\-\-packages\f[] argument.
If not specified, the default NuGet package cache is used.
It is found in the \f[C]\&.nuget/packages\f[] directory in the
user\[aq]s home directory on all operating systems (for example,
\f[C]/home/user1\f[] on Linux or \f[C]C:\\Users\\user1\f[] on Windows).
.PP
For project\-specific tooling, \f[C]dotnet\ restore\f[] first restores
the package in which the tool is packed, and then proceeds to restore
the tool\[aq]s dependencies as specified in its project.json.
.SS OPTIONS
.PP
\f[C][root]\f[]
.PP
A list of projects or project folders to restore.
The list can contain either a path to a \f[C]project.json\f[] file, or a
path to \f[C]global.json\f[] file or folder.
The restore operation runs recursively for all subdirectories and
restores for each given project.json file it finds.
.PP
\f[C]\-s\f[], \f[C]\-\-source\f[] [SOURCE]

Specifies a source to use during the restore operation.
This overrides all of the sources specified in the NuGet.config file(s).

.PP
\f[C]\-f\f[], \f[C]\-\-fallbacksource\f[] [FEED]

if all other sources fail.
All valid feed formats are allowed.
