Developer Guide
===============

## Prerequisites

In order to build .NET Command Line Interface, you need the following installed on you machine.

### For Windows

1. Visual Studio 2015 with Web Development Tools
  * Beta8 is available here and should work: http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=49442
    * Install `WebToolsExtensionsVS14.msi` and `DotNetVersionManager-x64.msi`
2. CMake (available from https://cmake.org/) on the PATH.
3. git (available from http://www.git-scm.com/) on the PATH.

### For Linux

1. CMake (available from https://cmake.org/) is required to build the native host `corehost`. Make sure to add it to the PATH.
2. git (available from http://www.git-scm.com/) on the PATH.
3. clang (available from http://clang.llvm.org) on the PATH.

### For OS X

1. Xcode
2. CMake (available from https://cmake.org/) on the PATH.
3. git (available from http://www.git-scm.com/) on the PATH.

## Building/Running

1. Run `build.cmd` or `build.sh` from the root depending on your OS.
2. Use `artifacts/{os}-{arch}/stage2/dotnet` to try out the `dotnet` command. You can also add `artifacts/{os}-{arch}/stage2` to the PATH if you want to run `dotnet` from anywhere.

## A simple test

1. `cd test\TestApp`
2. `dotnet run`


##Adding a Command

The donet CLI considers any executable on the path named `dotnet-{commandName}` to be a command it can call out to. `dotnet publish`, for example, is added to the path as an executable called `dotnet-publish`. To add a new command we must create the executable and then add it to the distribution packages for installation.

0. Create an issue on https://github.com/dotnet/cli and get consensus on the need for and behavior of the command.
1. Add a new project for the command. 
2. Add the project to Microsoft.DotNet.Cli.sln
3. Create a Readme.md for the command.
4. Add the project to the build scripts.
5. Add the project to the packaging scripts.

#### Add a new command project
Start by copying an existing command, like /src/Microsoft.DotNet.Tools.Init. Change the last part of the project name, .Init in this case, to the name of your command. 
Update the Name property in project.json as well, but use the `dotnet-{command}` syntax here.
Make sure to use the System.CommandLine parser so behavior is consistant across commands.

#### Add a Readme.md
Each command's project root should contain a manpage-style Readme.md that describes the usage of the command. See other commands for reference.

#### Add project to build scripts
1. Add the project to /scripts/build/build-stage.ps1
  - Add the project name to the `$Projects` list
2. Add the project to /scripts/build/build-stage.sh
  - Add the project name to the `PROJECTS` list
3. run *build* from the root directory and make sure your project is producing binaries in /artifacts/

#### Add command to packages
- Update the symlinks property of debian_config.json to include the new command
