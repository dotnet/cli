Developer Guide
===============

## Prerequisites

In order to build .NET Command Line Interface, you need the following installed on you machine.

### For Windows

1. Visual Studio 2015 with Web Development Tools
  * Beta8 is available here and should work: http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=49442
    * Install `WebToolsExtensionsVS14.msi` and `DotNetVersionManager-x64.msi`
2. CMake (available from https://cmake.org/) on the PATH.
3. git (available from http://www.git-scm.com/) on the PATH.

### For Linux

1. CMake (available from https://cmake.org/) is required to build the native host `corehost`. Make sure to add it to the PATH.
2. git (available from http://www.git-scm.com/) on the PATH.
3. clang (available from http://clang.llvm.org) on the PATH.

### For OS X

1. Xcode
2. CMake (available from https://cmake.org/) on the PATH.
3. git (available from http://www.git-scm.com/) on the PATH.
4. Install OpenSSL (a .NET Core requirement)
  - brew install openssl
  - brew link --force openssl

## Building/Running

1. Run `build.cmd` or `build.sh` from the root depending on your OS.
2. Use `artifacts/{os}-{arch}/stage2/bin/dotnet` to try out the `dotnet` command. You can also add `artifacts/{os}-{arch}/stage2/bin` to the PATH if you want to run `dotnet` from anywhere.

## A simple test

1. `cd TestAssets\TestProjects\TestSimpleIncrementalApp`
2. `dotnet restore`
3. `dotnet run`

## Running tests

All the CLI tests are located under `test`. In order to run them, after doing a restore on the CLI repo just do the following:

1. Navigate to a test project, for instance: `cd test\dotnet-test.UnitTests`
2. `dotnet test`

For unit test projects (they have UnitTests at the name), that's all that you need to do, as they take a dependency on the product code directly, which gets rebuilt by dotnet when you run the tests.

For E2E and functional tests, they all depend on the binaries located under `artifacts\rid\stage2\bin`. So, after changing the code, you will need to re-build the product code and copy the new bits to the folder above. For instance, imagine you changed something in dotnet itself, you would have to do the following:

1. `cd src\dotnet\`
2. `dotnet build`
3. `cp bin\debug\netstandardapp1.5\dotnet.dll artifacts\rid\stage2\bin`
4. `cd ..\..\test\dotnet-build.Tests`
5. `dotnet test`

##Adding a Command

The dotnet CLI considers any executable on the path named `dotnet-{commandName}` to be a command it can call out to. `dotnet publish`, for example, is added to the path as an executable called `dotnet-publish`. To add a new command we must create the executable and then add it to the distribution packages for installation.

0. Create an issue on https://github.com/dotnet/cli and get consensus on the need for and behaviour of the command.
1. Add a new project for the command. 
2. Add the project to Microsoft.DotNet.Cli.sln
3. Create a Readme.md for the command.
4. Add the project to the build scripts.
5. Add the project to the packaging scripts.

#### Add a new command project
Start by copying an existing command, like /src/dotnet-new.  
Update the Name property in project.json as well, and use the `dotnet-{command}` syntax here.
Make sure to use the System.CommandLine parser so behaviour is consistent across commands.

#### Add a Readme.md
Each command's project root should contain a manpage-style Readme.md that describes the usage of the command. See other commands for reference.

#### Add project to build scripts
1. Add the project to `/scripts/build/build-stage.ps1`
  - Add the project name to the `$Projects` list
2. Add the project to `/scripts/build/build-stage.sh`
  - Add the project name to the `PROJECTS` list
3. run *build* from the root directory and make sure your project is producing binaries in /artifacts/

#### Add command to packages
- Update the `symlinks` property of `packaging/debian/debian_config.json` to include the new command
- Update the `$Projects` property in `packaging/osx/scripts/postinstall`

#### Things to Know
- Any added commands are usually invoked through `dotnet {command}`. As a result of this, stdout and stderr are redirected through the driver (`dotnet`) and buffered by line. As a result of this, child commands should use Console.WriteLine in any cases where they expect output to be written immediately. Any uses of Console.Write should be followed by Console.WriteLine to ensure the output is written.
