        <!-- MicroBuild plugins can be installed in any parent directory up the tree from the project that is building.
        The use of a sentinel file (which will be installed automatically due to package dependencies from any plugin)
        will help us locate the plugin packages directory while being constrained to using MSBuild's intrinsic functions,
        since we want the imports to occur at evaluation time instead of when a specific target is executing.

        Note: All MicroBuild plugins must be installed to the same directory (under the same packages folder). If plugins
        are installed to different directories, the plugins which are in the directories closest to the executing project
        up the hierarchy will be discovered, and the ones higher up the tree will be ignored.

        way to load/parse that file with MSBuild intrinsics. We can check the other two mechanisms though, which are the %NUGET_PACKAGES%
